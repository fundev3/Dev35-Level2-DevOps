# Car Dealership Project

We got a base structre project for a console application that will be used on a vehicle fabric called "DevVechicle35 Motors".

This fabric will be in charge of creating a diferent set of vehicles with some basic features, this ones are
- Speed
- HorsePower
- Capacity
- Price
- Number of wheels

For the first stage, we want to be able to determine the price of a certain type of vehicle to be constructed, take in account that the type of vehicles will change and can grow, as well as we can add new features for a type of vehicle, a set of vehicles or all the vehicles.

Definition of Done:
- Pull Request must contain a description and if possible an image of the working implementation.
- All the features described on the AC must be completed.
- Pull Request description must contain link to the user story from Trello.

Team agreements:
- Classes, Interfaces and Enums will be on UpperCase and self-descriptive.
- Usage of StyleCop for Linting.
- If a warning is going to be supressed, the reason must be explained on the description of the Pull Request.
- Each Pull Request must have 4 approvals before merging.
- Commit messages should be in English, precise and descriptive.
- Branches should follow this convention: {feature-bug-hotfix}/{trello-card-number}-{description}

We will be working on pair of devs, we will implement a Pomodoro timing to switch roles.
