# Dev35-Level2-DevOps
We will use this branch to do some git command practices

Based on the teams that are asigned for the car dealership project we will do this.

1. Add at the "Team" section, the name for your team and the members of it. It must be a numbered list.
2. On the folder "Teams", create a new text file with a short description of both of you that has: Name, Country, Prefereed Coding Language. Naming should be "numberedllistorder-teamName.md", please use any formatting that you would like.
3. Add an image or logo that identifies your team.
4. On the description of your team add your hobbies.
5. Create a link from the "Team" section to this newly created file.
6. On the Git commands section, select any git command and add a short description as well as the source of the information.

**Note.-** If any team got to do some nice/interesting formatting on the Readme.md or the "Teams" file it will be notified to the different teams in order to refactor their files. This will be posted on the Teams Channel.

## Rules:

1. This branch will be protected, so you will need to create a Pull Request and let Alin know in order to merge it on the message post that is on the Channel.
2. Each task must have it's own branch and it's own pull request.
3. If you have a change to this file (such as formatting adding a dynamic TOC, formatting or other we will need a review from other team also). This is for extra points.
4. Pull request will be merged on the order we have it has been received.
5. Commmit messages must be clear, and follow this convention: **This commit will {commit-message}** (Ex. add file for team 1; create team name for team 2)
7. We will use merging for the branches, but we will squash commits when merging into the main branch. So stay focused to resolve conflicts, i'll be doing some changes while you work on this branches.
8. You can't continue on the next step until your branch has been merged and deleted.
