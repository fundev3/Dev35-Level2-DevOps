# Car Dealership Project

We got a base structre project for a console application that will be used on a vehicle fabric called "DevVechicle35 Motors".

This fabric will be in charge of creating a diferent set of vehicles with some basic features, this ones are
- Speed
- HorsePower
- Capacity
- Price
- Number of wheels

For the first stage, we want to be able to determine the price of a certain type of vehicle to be constructed, take in account that the type of vehicles will change and can grow, as well as we can add new features for a type of vehicle, a set of vehicles or all the vehicles.

Definition of Done:
- Pull Request must contain a description and if possible an image of the working implementation.
-
-

Team agreements:
- Classes, Interfaces and Enums will be on UpperCase and self-descriptive.
- 

We will be working on pair of devs, we will implement a Pomodoro timing to switch roles.
